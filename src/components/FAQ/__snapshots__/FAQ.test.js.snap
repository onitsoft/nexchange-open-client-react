                    Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                      Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Current referral conditions are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        If you would like to change withdrawal address or preferred currency, let us know in support, and we will take care of it.
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      These are subject to change at any time.

                      There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you did send your funds, but for some reason they were not detected, contact us through the support chat and we will help you out.

                      Yes. Promote Yoa.ltd on social media (such as Twitter). We would pay you 1000 SAT for every retweet from a legitimate, real account with over 500 followers and 100 SAT for each like from an account of the same criteria.

                      In order to use Yoa.ltd, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                      Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                        Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Current referral conditions are as follows:
                      </p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.

                        Yes. Promote Yoa.ltd on social media (such as Twitter). We would pay you 1000 SAT for every retweet from a legitimate, real account with over 500 followers and 100 SAT for each like from an account of the same criteria.

                        In order to use Yoa.ltd, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                        Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                          Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Current referral conditions are as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            If you would like to change withdrawal address or preferred currency, let us know in support, and we will take care of it.
                          </li>

                        <p>
                          These are subject to change at any time.

                          There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If you did send your funds, but for some reason they were not detected, contact us through the support chat and we will help you out.

                          Yes. Promote Yoa.ltd on social media (such as Twitter). We would pay you 1000 SAT for every retweet from a legitimate, real account with over 500 followers and 100 SAT for each like from an account of the same criteria.

                          In order to use Yoa.ltd, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                          Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                              We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.

                            There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.
                          </p>

                            If you did send your funds, but for some reason they were not detected, contact us through the support chat and we will help you out.

                            In order to use Yoa.ltd, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                          Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Current referral conditions are as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.

                          There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.

                          In order to use Yoa.ltd, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                      Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                        Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Current referral conditions are as follows:
                      </p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          If you would like to change withdrawal address or preferred currency, let us know in support, and we will take care of it.

                        There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you did send your funds, but for some reason they were not detected, contact us through the support chat and we will help you out.

                        Yes. Promote Yoa.ltd on social media (such as Twitter). We would pay you 1000 SAT for every retweet from a legitimate, real account with over 500 followers and 100 SAT for each like from an account of the same criteria.

                        In order to use Yoa.ltd, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                        Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                        <p>
                          Current referral conditions are as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                          </li>

                            You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.

                          There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                          Yes. Promote Yoa.ltd on social media (such as Twitter). We would pay you 1000 SAT for every retweet from a legitimate, real account with over 500 followers and 100 SAT for each like from an account of the same criteria.

                          In order to use Yoa.ltd, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                          Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                            Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Current referral conditions are as follows:
                          </p>
                          <ol>
                            <li>
                              We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                            </li>

                            There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.

                            In order to use Yoa.ltd, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                              Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Current referral conditions are as follows:
                            </p>
                            <ol>

                                We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.
                              </li>

                              There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.

                              In order to use Yoa.ltd, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                            Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Current referral conditions are as follows:
                          </p>
                          <ol>
                            <li>
                              We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              If you would like to change withdrawal address or preferred currency, let us know in support, and we will take care of it.

                            There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.
                          </p>

                            Yes. Promote Yoa.ltd on social media (such as Twitter). We would pay you 1000 SAT for every retweet from a legitimate, real account with over 500 followers and 100 SAT for each like from an account of the same criteria.

                    Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                        We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.

                      <li>
                        We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.

                        You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.

                      <li>

                      There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you did send your funds, but for some reason they were not detected, contact us through the support chat and we will help you out.

                      Yes. Promote Yoa.ltd on social media (such as Twitter). We would pay you 1000 SAT for every retweet from a legitimate, real account with over 500 followers and 100 SAT for each like from an account of the same criteria.

                      In order to use Yoa.ltd, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                      Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                        Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Current referral conditions are as follows:
                      </p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          If you would like to change withdrawal address or preferred currency, let us know in support, and we will take care of it.

                        There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.

                        Yes. Promote Yoa.ltd on social media (such as Twitter). We would pay you 1000 SAT for every retweet from a legitimate, real account with over 500 followers and 100 SAT for each like from an account of the same criteria.

                        In order to use Yoa.ltd, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                        Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                          Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Current referral conditions are as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            If you would like to change withdrawal address or preferred currency, let us know in support, and we will take care of it.
                          </li>

                        <p>
                          These are subject to change at any time.

                          There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If you did send your funds, but for some reason they were not detected, contact us through the support chat and we will help you out.

                          Yes. Promote Yoa.ltd on social media (such as Twitter). We would pay you 1000 SAT for every retweet from a legitimate, real account with over 500 followers and 100 SAT for each like from an account of the same criteria.

                          In order to use N.exchange, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                          Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                          <p>
                            Current referral conditions are as follows:

                              We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                            </li>

                            There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If you did send your funds, but for some reason they were not detected, contact us through the support chat and we will help you out.

                            Yes. Promote N.exchange on social media (such as Twitter). We would pay you 1000 SAT for every retweet from a legitimate, real account with over 500 followers and 100 SAT for each like from an account of the same criteria.

                            In order to use N.exchange, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                        Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                          Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Current referral conditions are as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.
                          </li>
                          <li>

                          There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.

                      Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                        Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Current referral conditions are as follows:
                      </p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          If you would like to change withdrawal address or preferred currency, let us know in support, and we will take care of it.
                        </li>

                        There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you did send your funds, but for some reason they were not detected, contact us through the support chat and we will help you out.

                        Yes. Promote N.exchange on social media (such as Twitter). We would pay you 1000 SAT for every retweet from a legitimate, real account with over 500 followers and 100 SAT for each like from an account of the same criteria.

                        In order to use N.exchange, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                        Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                          Current referral conditions are as follows:

                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.

                          There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.

                          In order to use N.exchange, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                          Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                            Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.

                          <p>
                            Current referral conditions are as follows:
                          </p>
                          <ol>
                            <li>
                              We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                            </li>

                            There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.

                            In order to use N.exchange, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                            Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.

                              Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Current referral conditions are as follows:
                            </p>
                            <ol>

                                We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                If you would like to change withdrawal address or preferred currency, let us know in support, and we will take care of it.

                              There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.

                              Yes. Promote N.exchange on social media (such as Twitter). We would pay you 1000 SAT for every retweet from a legitimate, real account with over 500 followers and 100 SAT for each like from an account of the same criteria.

                              In order to use N.exchange, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.

                            Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Current referral conditions are as follows:
                          </p>
                          <ol>
                            <li>
                              We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                            There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.

                            Yes. Promote N.exchange on social media (such as Twitter). We would pay you 1000 SAT for every retweet from a legitimate, real account with over 500 followers and 100 SAT for each like from an account of the same criteria.

                            In order to use N.exchange, you need to have your own wallet. The main upside of this feature is that we don’t hold your coins, and thus you retain full control over your assets at all times.
