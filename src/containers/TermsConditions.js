            N.EXCHANGE takes an exchange fee for using the service. The fee is
            0.5% of the transaction volume for cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency
            transitions on cryptocurrency majors (BTC, ETH, LTC and similar), 1%
            on minors (the rest) and 2% on fiat pairs (such as BTCEUR). In
            addition to those 2%, a payment processor fee of 5%-7% might be

            by you.

          <p>
            All fees are transparent and already included in the calculated
            order price. The fee can be a subject to reasonable fluctuations due
            to the mathematical rounding.
