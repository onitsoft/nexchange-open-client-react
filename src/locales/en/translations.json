    "ans4": "<0>Initiating a transaction doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes. The actual processing takes about 10–60 minutes before you receive your coins in your desired currency. The transaction time depends on the selected currencies and their respective blockchains.</0>",

    "ans10": "<0>Every order has a unique id like this:</0><1></1><2>Make sure you record your order id. We recommend bookmarking the page, you can always navigate to it later.</2><3>Once you have sent the cryptocurrency, losing connection, closing the tab or navigating elsewhere will not impact the transaction.</3><4>If you need help, feel free to contact us.</4>",
    "ans11": "<0>Whenever you create an order, a referral code is automatically generated for you.</0><1>Current referral conditions are as follows:</1><2><0>We pay half of our revenues to the affiliates. One fourth of revenues for 2nd degree affiliates and one eighth of revenues for 3rd degree affiliates.</0><1>We send referral payouts once the funds accumulated on your account reach the threshold. The threshold amount is typically 10 times the minimal order amount (no tx fee), but it can be adjusted downward, in which case, you would need to cover the tx fee yourself.</1><2>You will be receiving your funds to the withdraw address specified on this order.</2><3>If you would like to change withdrawal address or preferred currency, let us know in support, and we will take care of it.</3></2><3>These are subject to change at any time.</3>",
    "ans12": "<0>There's a 15-minute window between the moment you open the order and the moment we detect the coins that you sent on the blockchain. During this time interval, we effectively freeze the price for your order.</0><1>If the 15 minute time window closes, the order is canceled because the price will have expired and will need to be recalculated.</1><2>If you did not send your funds in time, simply initiate a new order.</2><3>If you did send your funds, but for some reason they were not detected, contact us through the support chat and we will help you out.</3>",
    "ans13": "<0>Yes. Promote N.exchange on social media (such as Twitter).
